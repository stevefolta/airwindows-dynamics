airwindows-dynamics
=====

This is a CLAP plugin for Linux with the Airwindows dynamics plugins, with a
rudimentary UI added that includes a gain-reduction meter.

But take those meters with a BIG grain of salt.

My understanding of the Airwindows algorithms is _extremely_ limited, so in
many cases it wasn't clear to me how to measure gain reduction.  It may well be
that the behavior of some Airwindows plugins is too complex for a simple "gain
reduction" meter to be meaningful.  (DrumSlam was so far off that I haven't
even included it.)
